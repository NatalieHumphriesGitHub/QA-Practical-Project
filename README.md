# QA-Practical-Project

# Introduction

This repository contains my deliverable for the QA DevOps practical project. The ReadMe document outlines my approach to the project, describing how the project was executed and explaining the theory behind the app design and the CI pipeline utilised. 

# Project Brief

The project brief was to create a service-orientated architecture for an application that was composed of at least four services that worked together. Producing this application would allow us to demonstrate the skills learnt from the first 9 weeks of the DevOps course, including: 

* Software Development with Python
* Continuous Integration
* Cloud Fundamentals

The key requirements and the tools to be used were as follows:

The application had to be successfully deployed via the CI Pipeline and a live rolling update had to be executed successfully without any downtime to the user experience. 

# Project Planning

For this project, I used Jira software to help me plan out the various tasks that I would be required to do. I chose this software because I was familar with it and it allowed me to work in a KanBan style within sprints and also divide tasks into smaller subtasks. I created epics for the larger chunks of work that I needed to do, and then spent some time thinking about the different tasks that were required in order to achieve my deliverables. Where relevant, I wrote user stories and linked them to the tasks that were required to fulfil them (see example below) Each task or sub task was assigned a story point value so that I could split the work evenly across the sprints and ensure that they could all be completed in the allocated timeframe. This produced a roadmap as shown below.
