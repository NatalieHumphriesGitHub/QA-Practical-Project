# QA-Practical-Project

# Introduction

This repository contains my deliverable for the QA DevOps practical project. The ReadMe document outlines my approach to the project, describing how the project was executed and explaining the theory behind the app design and the CI pipeline utilised. 

# Project Brief

The project brief was to create a service-orientated architecture for an application that was composed of at least four services that worked together. Producing this application would allow us to demonstrate the skills learnt from the first 9 weeks of the DevOps course, including: 

* Software Development with Python
* Continuous Integration
* Cloud Fundamentals

The key requirements were as follows:

An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.
